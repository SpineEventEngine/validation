/**
 * An implementation of [ValidationPlugin] for Java language.
 *
 * The validation constraints for Java are implemented with two renderers:
 *
 * 1. [JavaValidationRenderer] is the main renderer for Java. It renders the validation
 * code for all options that perform an assertion upon a message field value.
 * 2. [SetOnceRenderer] is responsible for the validation code of `(set_once)` option.
 * It is a standalone renderer because it significantly differs from the rest of constraints.
 * Its implementation modifies the message builder behavior, affecting every setter or merge
 * method that can change the field value.
