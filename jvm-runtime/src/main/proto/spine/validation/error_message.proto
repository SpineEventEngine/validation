// Represents a template string with placeholders and a map for further substituting
// those placeholders with the actual values.
//
// Placeholders are specified using the format `${key}`, where `key` is the identifier
// for the value to be substituted from the `placeholder_value` map. There are no
// expectations about the identifier format. It can be `myKey`, `my.key`, `my_key`, etc.
//
// Example usage:
//     template_string = "My dog's name is ${dog.name}."
//     placeholder_values = { "dog.name": "Fido" }
//
// After substitution, the final output would be:
//     "My dog's name is Fido."
//
// Each placeholder `key` referenced in the template string must have a corresponding entry
// in the `placeholder_value` map. However, the `placeholder_value` map is not restricted to
// containing only the placeholders used in the template. Additional entries in the map
// that do not correspond to placeholders in the template string are permitted.

    // excluding the `${}` placeholder markers.

    // All placeholders present in `with_placeholders` must have corresponding entries
    // in this map. Otherwise, the template is considered invalid.
