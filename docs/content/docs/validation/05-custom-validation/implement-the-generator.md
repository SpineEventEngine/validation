# Implement the `Generator`

The `Generator` produces Java code for every application of the option within a compiled message
type. The framework calls `codeFor` once per message type and inlines each returned
`SingleOptionCode` into the generated `validate()` method.

## Class declaration

```kotlin
internal class WhenGenerator : OptionGeneratorWithConverter()
```

Use `OptionGeneratorWithConverter` when your generated code needs to convert a Protobuf field
value to a Java expression — for example, to format a field value as a JSON string in an error
message. This base class injects a `JavaValueConverter` that handles the conversion. Use the
plain `OptionGenerator` base class when no value conversion is needed.

## Querying the `View`

```kotlin
private val allWhenFields by lazy {
    querying.select<WhenField>().all()
}
```

`querying` is injected by the framework and provides read access to all accumulated `View`
instances. The `by lazy` delegate is required because `querying` is not available until the
framework initialises the generator; accessing it during construction causes an error. The
query result is cached after the first call.

## `codeFor` override

```kotlin
override fun codeFor(type: TypeName): List<SingleOptionCode> =
    allWhenFields
        .filter { it.id.type == type }
        .map { GenerateWhen(it, converter).code() }
```

The framework calls `codeFor` once for each message type it processes. Filter the view list
by `id.type == type` to select only the fields that belong to the current message. Each
filtered view is passed to a helper that composes the actual `CodeBlock`.

Each `SingleOptionCode` wraps a `CodeBlock` that is inlined directly into the generated
`validate()` method, so the code must be a valid Java statement or block.

For complete context, see
[`WhenGenerator.kt`](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/time/blob/master/validation/src/main/kotlin/io/spine/tools/time/validation/java/WhenGenerator.kt)
in the Spine Time repository.

## Generated code paths

The `GenerateWhen.code()` method chooses the Java code shape for a single application of
the `(when)` option:

- For a single message field, it generates one validation block for the field value.
- For a repeated message field, it generates a `for` loop and validates each element inside
  that loop.

Both branches delegate to the same `validateTime(...)` helper, so the time comparison,
violation construction, and placeholder handling stay in one place. The difference is only
where the checked value comes from: the field getter for a single message, or the loop variable
for each repeated element.

See the full source around
[`GenerateWhen.code()`](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/time/blob/master/validation/src/main/kotlin/io/spine/tools/time/validation/java/WhenGenerator.kt#L105-L117)
for the exact generated Java shape.
