# Extension points

Spine Validation exposes two extension points and only two. They sit on opposite sides of
the compile-time / runtime split:

- The [`ValidationOption`][validation-option-spi] SPI (build time) — adds a *new
  validation option* with its own model, codegen, and runtime helpers.
- The [`MessageValidator`][message-validator] SPI (runtime) — adds a *custom check on a
  specific message type*, executed alongside the compiled constraints.

Each surface has a corresponding User's Guide section that explains how to *use* it:
“[Custom validation](../user/05-custom-validation/)” for `ValidationOption`, and
“[Using validators](../user/04-validators/)” for `MessageValidator`. This page is the
contributor-side view: what each surface guarantees, how discovery works, what an
implementation may and may not do, and why.

The earlier sections of the Developer's Guide cover each surface in detail —
“[The validation model](validation-model.md)” and “[Java code generation](java-code-generation.md)”
for the build-time half, and “[Runtime library](runtime-library.md)” for the runtime half.
This page consolidates the two into a single picture.

## The two surfaces at a glance

| Aspect       | `ValidationOption`                                                  | `MessageValidator`                                                                                         |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Granularity  | A new `.proto` option, applicable to many messages.                 | A custom check on one specific message type.                                                               |
| When it runs | Build time (codegen) plus optional runtime helpers it ships itself. | Runtime: after compiled checks for local messages; via `ValidatorRegistry` for external/direct validation. |
| Inputs       | Reads the model in `:context`, emits Java via `:java`.              | Receives a built `Message`, returns `List<DetectedViolation>`.                                             |
| Discovery    | `ServiceLoader<ValidationOption>` on the Compiler user classpath.   | `ServiceLoader<MessageValidator>` in the consumer's classpath.                                             |
| Required by  | Adding a new constraint vocabulary (`(when)`, `(currency)`, …).     | Constraints that cannot be expressed declaratively, or external types.                                     |
| Lives in     | Defined in `:java`; implementations live in their own modules.      | Defined in `:jvm-runtime`; implementations live in any consumer module.                                    |

The two are deliberately not interchangeable. A `ValidationOption` is the right choice
when the same constraint vocabulary applies across many messages and benefits from
declarative configuration in `.proto` files. A `MessageValidator` is the right choice
when the constraint is specific to one message type, or when the message type is external
and cannot carry options at all.

## The `ValidationOption` SPI end-to-end

The [`ValidationOption`][validation-option-spi] SPI is intentionally narrow. A custom
option contributes exactly three things, matching the build-time pipeline:

1. `reactions` — reaction instances that subscribe to the upstream
   `FieldOptionDiscovered` / `OneofOptionDiscovered` / `MessageOptionDiscovered` events,
   filter by `OPTION_NAME`, validate applicability, and emit a `*Discovered` domain
   event. See “[The validation model](validation-model.md#the-lifecycle-of-an-option)”.
2. `view` — Protobuf-declared projections that fold those domain events into queryable
   state. See “[The validation model](validation-model.md#the-projection)”.
3. `generator` — an [`OptionGenerator`][option-generator] subclass that queries the
   projection and emits one `SingleOptionCode` per option application. See
   “[Java code generation](java-code-generation.md#the-optiongenerator-spi)”.

`JavaValidationPlugin` discovers SPI implementations through `ServiceLoader` and folds
them into the same plugin registration that brings in the built-ins:

```kotlin
public open class JavaValidationPlugin : ValidationPlugin(
    renderers = listOf(
        JavaValidationRenderer(customGenerators = customOptions.map { it.generator }),
        SetOnceRenderer()
    ),
    views = customOptions.flatMap { it.view }.toSet(),
    reactions = customOptions.flatMap { it.reactions }.toSet(),
)

private val customOptions: List<ValidationOption> by lazy {
    ServiceLoader.load(ValidationOption::class.java)
        .filterNotNull()
}
```

From the model's point of view, custom reactions and views are indistinguishable from
the built-ins. From the renderer's point of view, the custom `generator` receives the
same `Querying` and `TypeSystem` as the built-ins and contributes to the same
`validate()` method. Built-ins and custom options share one pipeline, not two.

### Discovery

A `ValidationOption` implementation is discovered through the standard Java
`ServiceLoader` SPI:

- The implementing class must be on the **Spine Compiler user classpath**, not merely
  on the application runtime classpath. In a Gradle build that consumes Validation, this
  means the module declaring the option is added to the Spine Compiler user classpath (see
  “[Pass the option to the Compiler](../user/05-custom-validation/pass-to-compiler.md)”).
- A `META-INF/services/io.spine.tools.validation.java.ValidationOption` entry must list
  the implementing class. The conventional way to generate it is the
  `@AutoService(ValidationOption::class)` annotation processor; any other mechanism that
  produces the same descriptor is equivalent.
- The class must have a public no-arg constructor — the `ServiceLoader` contract.

In addition to the SPI implementation itself, two more pieces of build-time wiring are
required for the option to work: the option's Protobuf descriptor must be discoverable
through `OptionsProvider` (so the Compiler recognises the option when parsing
`.proto` files), and the consumer's build must place the option's module on the
Compiler user classpath. Both are covered in the User's Guide; the SPI itself does not
attempt to encode them.

### Lifecycle

Discovered implementations are constructed when a `JavaValidationPlugin` instance is
created — its constructor dereferences the top-level `customOptions` lazy while collecting
generators, views, and reactions. From that point on, the same instance is used for the
entire build:

- Each `Reaction` instance returned by `reactions` is registered with the Bounded
  Context exactly once. Reactions are stateless by contract.
- Each `View` class returned by `view` is registered once and instantiated by the
  framework as needed. Views accumulate state per projection key.
- The single `generator` instance is the one passed to `JavaValidationRenderer`. The
  renderer calls `inject(querying, typeSystem)` on it before the first `codeFor()`
  invocation, and `codeFor(type)` is called once per message type in the
  `SourceFileSet`. The instance must therefore be safe to reuse across messages within a
  single build — see “[Java code generation](java-code-generation.md#the-render-lifecycle)”.

### Ordering

The order in which custom generators contribute to a generated `validate()` is
unspecified. Generators must not rely on running before or after any built-in or any
other custom generator: each contribution is a self-contained `if (…) { violations.add(…) }`
block, and accumulating violations (rather than short-circuiting) is what lets the
ordering stay free.

The same is true on the model side. Reactions and views run in event-delivery order; a
custom view that needs to fold both its primary event and a companion event must accept
either ordering, exactly the way `RequiredFieldView` accepts `RequiredFieldDiscovered`
and `IfMissingOptionDiscovered` in either order (see
“[Companion options](validation-model.md#companion-options)”).

## The `MessageValidator` SPI

The runtime extension surface is [`MessageValidator<M>`][message-validator]. Use it for
checks that cannot be expressed in `.proto` options at all — because the rule depends on
multiple fields, on external state, or on a message type whose source the consumer cannot
modify. The registry API, the `${validator}` placeholder, and the `DetectedViolation`
shape are covered in “[Runtime library](runtime-library.md#the-validator-extension-hook)”
and “[Using `ValidatorRegistry`](../user/04-validators/validator-registry.md)”; this section
keeps to the extension contract.

### Discovery

For automatic discovery, the implementation must be on the consumer application's runtime
classpath and listed in
`META-INF/services/io.spine.validation.MessageValidator`. `@AutoService` is only a
convenient way to produce that descriptor; there is no Validation-specific discovery
annotation.

The class must have a public no-arg constructor, and its concrete `M` type parameter must
be recoverable from the validator class. Direct implementations such as
`MessageValidator<MyType>` are the clearest shape; base classes are fine as long as
Guava's `TypeToken` can still resolve `M` to a concrete `Message` class.

### Lifecycle

`MessageValidator` instances are constructed by `ServiceLoader` when `ValidatorRegistry`
is initialized, or explicitly by application code before registration. Once registered,
an instance is retained and invoked on every matching validation. The registry itself is
annotated `@ThreadSafe` and dispatches concurrently: implementations must therefore be
safe to invoke from multiple threads at once.

### Ordering and composition

`ValidatorRegistry` stores validators keyed by qualified message class name. When a
message of type `M` is validated:

- For a **local** message (one whose generated class is produced by the Java renderer in
  this build), the generated `validate()` first runs every compiled constraint and then
  consults `ValidatorRegistry` for any registered validators on `M`. Compiled checks and
  validators all contribute to the same `ValidationError`.
- For an **external** message (one whose generated class is not produced in this build),
  the registry is the only entry point. A local message reaches external validators only
  through fields marked `(validate) = true`; a standalone external instance is not
  validated unless the caller invokes `Validate.check` or `ValidatorRegistry.validate`
  directly.

The order in which validators of the same message type run is unspecified. Validators
must report independently of their peers because the registry concatenates all reports.

## Constraints on what extensions can do

Both SPIs are deliberately narrow. The constraints below are not arbitrary; they fall
out of the compile-time / runtime split that the rest of the architecture is built on
(see “[Architecture](architecture.md)”).

### `ValidationOption`

- **No file I/O at generation time.** The generator must derive everything from the view
  state populated by reactions. Reading `.proto` files, querying descriptors at runtime,
  or scanning the file system from inside `codeFor()` defeats the model's reason to
  exist — the renderer is supposed to be replaceable with a renderer for another target
  language without touching `:context`.
- **No mutation of the message PSI directly.** Return constraints, supporting fields, and
  supporting methods through `SingleOptionCode`; placement is the
  [`ValidationCodeInjector`][validation-code-injector]'s job. Directly adding methods,
  fields, or interface implementations from inside a generator bypasses the conventions
  for the shape of generated validators (see
  “[Java code generation](java-code-generation.md#injecting-the-code-into-the-psi)”).
- **No silent failure.** A misapplied option must fail compilation through
  `Compilation.check` / `Compilation.error`, not be quietly skipped. Reactions that
  decide an option does not apply must return `NoReaction`, not throw.
- **No interpreting at runtime.** If an option needs runtime helpers, they must ship in
  a separate module that the generated code calls into — like `:jvm-runtime` does for
  the built-ins. The runtime must not parse `.proto` descriptors to recover what the
  generator already knew.

### `MessageValidator`

- **No descriptor scanning.** The runtime is intentionally free of descriptor-driven
  rule discovery. A validator that wants to apply different rules to different fields
  must do so in code, not by re-deriving a model at runtime.
- **No reflection-driven dispatch in the hot path.** The registry does a single
  `ConcurrentHashMap` lookup keyed by class name. The reflection that recovers `M` from
  the validator's class runs once, at registration. Validators must not extend that
  reflection cost into per-call dispatch.
- **No assumptions about ordering or peers.** A validator must produce a correct report
  regardless of which other validators (built-in, custom, registered explicitly,
  registered through `ServiceLoader`) run alongside it.
- **Thread-safety is on the implementer.** The registry is `@ThreadSafe`; validators
  must be too. Per-call mutable state must be local to the call.
- **Use `DetectedViolation`, not `ConstraintViolation`.** The registry is responsible
  for translating `DetectedViolation` to `ConstraintViolation`, packing values into
  `Any`, prefixing field paths with the parent path, and stamping the type name. A
  validator that bypasses `DetectedViolation` cannot participate in nested validation
  correctly.

### Why these constraints exist

The compile-time / runtime split is what lets the runtime stay small (see
“[Runtime library](runtime-library.md#constraints-on-the-runtime-surface)”) and the
language-agnostic model stay portable (see
“[The validation model](validation-model.md)”). Both extension points are designed so
that a well-behaved implementation reinforces that split:

- A `ValidationOption` adds a new constraint vocabulary without forcing a runtime rule
  engine into existence — the constraint becomes inlined Java like every built-in.
- A `MessageValidator` adds a runtime-only check without leaking knowledge of the
  Compiler, the model, or codegen — it is opaque to everything below the
  `MessageValidator` boundary.

The constraints above are how each SPI keeps that property; they are also why neither
SPI exposes more knobs than it does. New extension points should be evaluated against
the same split before they are added.
