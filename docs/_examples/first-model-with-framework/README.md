# Using Validation in a Spine-based project

This project uses the same sources as the [`first-model`][first-model] example,
but with the Spine CoreJvm Gradle plugin applied.

Same sources are arranged using the `src` symlink, which points to the `src` directory of
the [`first-model`][first-model] example. 

This way, you can compare the two projects and see how the Gradle configuration differs.

[first-model]: ../first-model/
